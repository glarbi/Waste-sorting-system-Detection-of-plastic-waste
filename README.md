# Abstract
Nowadays, several research teams are working on the development and optimization of real-time object detection systems.
Among the applications of these systems is vision-based waste sorting. The main problems encountered in this field are the execution time, the accuracy, ...
Problematic and scientific objective
In this project, we will focus on the problem of computation time as well as on the elimination of false positives and false negatives which remarkably deteriorate the accuracy of the plastic waste detection process in order to protect the environment.
